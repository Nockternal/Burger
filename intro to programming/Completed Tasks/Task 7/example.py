# =============  Writing if statements ==================
# if statements are a type of control structure which controls the flow of logic within a program.
# if statements contain a condition.
# Conditions are statements that can only evaluate to True or False
# If the condition is True then the indented statements are executed; if the condition is False then the indented statements are skipped 
# In Python, if statements have the following general syntax:
#               if condition :
#                       indented statements



# ************ Example 1 ************
age = 20
if age >= 18:
        print ("You're over 18 and can come in.")


# Explanation:
# We check if the age is greater than or equal to 18,
# If the age is 18 or older, then print out "You're over 18 and can come in."
# If they are not 18 or older, then the print statement is skipped and nothing is printed. 


# =============  Some FAQs on the Syntax of if Statements ==================
#  Q: Why is there a colon at the end of the if statement?
#  A: The colon, as in the English language, serves the purpose of adding extra information.
#      In Python, the colon means that here is code following that statement and can only run if the statement's criteria are met.


#  Q: Why is the code after the colon indented? And is it important?
#  A: The indentation means that certain code follows from the colon and in this case we have that certain code following from the if statements. 
#      The indentation is there to demonstrate that the program's logic will follow the path indicated by it.
#      Every line in the indentation will run if the program's if statement's conditions are met.


#  Q: Why do we write the lines of code below each other? 
#  A: The way that programs are run is done in a similar manner to how we humans read books or a newspaper.
#      We read from the top through to the bottom, in programming, this concept is called sequential programming.
#      Sequential programming involves a consecutive and ordered execution of statements, one after the other.
#      Sequential programming is the only programming philosophy we are going follow in this course.



# ****************** END OF EXAMPLE CODE ********************* # 


# == Make sure you have read and understood all of the code in this Python file.
# == Please complete the compulsory task below to proceed to the next task ===
# == Ensure you complete your work in this folder so that one of our tutors can easily locate and mark it ===



# ================= Compulsory Task ==================
# Create a Python file called “baby.py” in this folder.
# This program will be used to test if the user is over 18 and allowed entry into a party. 
# Ask the user to enter the year they were born and calculate if they are older than 18.
# If they are older then display a message saying “Congrats you are old enough”

# ================= BONUS Optional Task ==================
# Create a Python file called "Optional_task" in this folder.
# This program should test whether a number is odd or even 
# Ask the user to enter an integer
# Test whether the number entered is odd or even 
# Print out the number and whether it is odd or even
